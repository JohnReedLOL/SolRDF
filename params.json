{"name":"SolRDF","tagline":"An RDF plugin for Solr  ","body":"SolRDF (i.e. Solr + RDF) is a set of Solr extensions for managing (index and search) RDF data. \r\n\r\nThis page will guide you through the SolRDF quick installation. I assume you already have Java (7), Maven (3.x) and git on your system.\r\n\r\nCheckout the project Open a new shell and type the following:\r\n\r\n> cd /tmp  \r\n> git clone https://github.com/agazzarini/SolRDF.git solrdf-download\r\n\r\nBuild and run SolrRDF\r\n\r\n> cd solrdf-download/solrdf  \r\n> mvn clean install cargo:run  \r\n\r\nThe very first time you run this command a lot of things will be downloaded, Solr included. At the end you should see sheomething like this:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Jetty 7.6.15.v20140411 Embedded started on port [8080]\r\n[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...\r\n\r\nSolRDF is up and running! Now let's add some data. Open a new shell and type the following\r\n\r\n> curl -v http://localhost:8080/solr/store/update/bulk?commit=true \\  \r\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/n-triples\" \\  \r\n  --data-binary @/tmp/solrdf-download/solrdf/src/sample-data/bsbm-generated-dataset.nt  \r\n\r\nOk, you just added about 5000 triples. Now, it's time to execute some query:\r\n\r\n> curl \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/solr/store/sparql\" \\  \r\n  --data-urlencode \"q=SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10\" \\  \r\n  -H \"Accept: application/sparql-results+xml\"  \r\n\r\n> ...      \r\n\r\n>  curl \"http://127.0.0.1:8080/solr/store/sparql\" \\   \r\n  --data-urlencode \"q=SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 10\" \\  \r\n  -H \"Accept: application/sparql-results+json\"  \r\n  \r\n>  ...\r\n\r\nEt voil√†! Enjoy! As you can imagine I'm still working on that...so if you meet some annoying bug feel free to give me a shout ;)\r\n","google":"UA-59066378-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
